# My C Programming Journey

This repository contains a structured collection of **C programming implementations** covering fundamentals, data structures, algorithms, and practical code examples. The purpose of this collection is to demonstrate a deep understanding of C language concepts through real, working code.

This is not just practice code — each example is written with clarity, structure, and reuse in mind to reflect professional coding practices.

##  Why This Repository Matters

This is **more than a collection of snippets** — it shows:

- Clear understanding of core firmware language (C)
- Structured approaches to solve problems
- Ability to organize code for readability and maintainability
- Preparedness for real-world embedded firmware tasks

Strong knowledge of C is a **prerequisite for firmware engineers**, and this journey demonstrates that competency.
